                            <p class="mt-3 text"><strong class="fontHeading">"He who has a way to live can bear almost any how."</strong> One of my favourite quotes by Nietzsche. Ever since I was a young kid, I saw a lot of people struggle with navigating challenges, regulating basic emotions, not knowing how to deal with the mental issues that develop due to botting everything inside for the longest time. No one taught them how to Loosen the cork and let it out slowly. Challenges inevitably occur in life, but when things get out of hand, sometimes all we need is a non judgemental ear. As I grew up, in adolescence I faced some mental stressors myself. I struggled. As I grew up, my interest and passion in psychology was ignited by my professors-both in junior college and in degree college. One of them used to say, <strong class="fontHeading">"Psychology should walk with you." </strong>
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text">
                                After that, I was offered a very human to human contact by a kind soul, who was a psychologist. It became my life's purpose to be that kind soul to someone, to help them help themselves out of their darkness, to just be present. If I could be that for one person, my life would be worth it. Psychology made me, inevitably, a more empathetic, patient, the kind of person that loves the fact that humans are wired to hope. It made me more humane. I always wanted to be able to empower people to grow and witness their growth. I had a dream that I will have my own clinic when I'm like 30 and then I shall do what I was always meant to do. It will have the non judgemental space and practice compassion and will lead people to light by going beyond the traditional ways.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text">I'm full of gratefulness that I got to start this establishment and aim to spread the kindness, light and a lend an ear-lend a hand to as many drowning people as I can.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text">Beyond the box with Bhakti is nothing but a kid who had stars in her eyes' dream, realised.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text">More often than not, I am asked why I came back from the UK after my Masters instead of settling there. And my answer has always been the same. I have noticed that the therapy and psychological awareness are the need of the hour for our country. The West already has established mental healthcare, and the common man there knows the importance of mental health whereas here, people are only now waking up to the importance of therapy and mental health. I feel like I have can offer a unique approach to the healing of my clients, integrating the good things from the West- like some of their therapies, views on boundaries and standing out, and the best from our own roots- like yoga, healing with nature and a lot of times, spirituality; brining a unique harmony of both to the table. I want to be able to give back to the society that gave me so much to begin with. </p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text">My vision for Beyond the Box is that it will function as a well oiled machine of a core team that will support people and bring mental awareness and work on their well being, eventually growing into a community of people who can support others in turn. </p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text"><strong>My Philosophy, both in life as well as in my practise as a therapist is : </strong>Be humane. If even one person is able to smile because of me, if I can make a difference in just one life, my whole endeavour will be worth it. I want to help people help themselves. I aspire to be like my teachers, to make sure my psychology, my empathy, walks with me. I imbibe in life what I imbibe in therapy- to always keep the door open, to never stop learning. I learn from my clients, oft times more than they learn from me.
                            My approach is open, flexible and eclectic- using this technique from here and that technique from there to make a tailor made therapeutic plan that best benefits each client, working towards their therapy goals in collaboration. Know that the techniques and therapies are well researched, scientific in nature. Your mental health is our priority.
