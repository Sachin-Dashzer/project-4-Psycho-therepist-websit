                                <p>There is extensive research done on a number of talk therapies like CBT and REBT is proven effective for depression and anxiety disorders, OCD and other mental health issues. Psychoanalytic therapy, more specifically Transactional analysis is proven effective for childhood trauma and dealing with grief.

                                <p>You can schedule a 15 minute free consultation call with the therapist to discuss the basics of what is affecting you and just introduce yourself. After that, an initial intake session will be conducted in which the therapist takes your detailed history. Based on this, a therapeutic plan is devised and worked upon in subsequent sessions by the therapist and the client in collaboration. Please refer to the detailed explanation of how the process works in each services section. </p>

                                <p>Therapy is a collaborative process that takes place over some sessions. Progress and healing looks different for each client, but you can see the manifestation of it in several ways including improved mood, symptom reduction, better sleeping patterns and appetite, changing thinking patterns and feeling and being able to deal with stressors yourself eventually.</p>

Similarly, not all clients are the right fit for all therapists. If the therapist is the right fit for you, you will feel seen and heard by them. They will not belittle your issues and you will not feel judged by them. You will feel comfortable and safe and will be able to see some amount of progress. They will call you out, when need be and even hold you accountable, however, you will look forward to the sessions. </p>
