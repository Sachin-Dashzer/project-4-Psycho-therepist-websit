                            <p class="mt-3">Individual therapy is for you, me, everyone. Individual therapy is therapy taken by an individual in one on one sessions with the therapist. It is a collaborative process that can help one achieve goals, work on self improvement, unlearn and heal from past trauma as well as deal effectively with present challenges in life with the help of a tailor made therapy plan by an expert. Take a deep dive and get to know yourself-nay work on yourself. </p>
                            <p class="mt-2">Individual therapy is a collaborative process that facilitates change so that you learn to fish, rather than the fish being handed to you. In the first session, known as the Initial Interview session, the therapist and the client get to know one another, the therapist takes a bit of history and a few goals are ascertained by the client and the therapist. Then, according to the need as well as the depth of the challenge that the client is facing, a semi structured but flexible personalised therapy plan is devised by the therapist. The therapist takes feedback from the client from time to time, implementing changes in the therapy plan or approach wherever necessary. The duration of the therapy journey varies from client to client, with both the client and the therapist having full autonomy to terminate at any given time. A variety of concerns are addressed in individual therapy, from minor adjustment issues, to Anxiety, ADHD, depression, trauma, financial stressors, personal stressors, etc. Work on you to make it work!</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">India, being a country with a rich, highly collectivistic culture, has it’s own way in which families are loked at. Family is an important part of our lives, so much so that we say’ Vasudhiva kutambakam”- All the world is my family. It also comes with it’s own unique challenges and issues. So get to know your family, work on a wide range of issues like behavioural conflicts, family conflicts, communication issues, anger, financial distress, life transitions, substance abuse, generational trauma, major health diagnosis, chronic health conditions, anger, dysfunction, divorce, etc and work on the bonds of your family to build healthy coping skills, conflict resolution, healthy boundary setting, communication and create a nurturing, positive family environment. </p>
                            <p class="mt-2">The fact that I have been born and brought up in our culture and have also seen and experienced how families in individualistic cultures function firsthand, allows me to provide a unique blend of therapeutic interventions that are culture informed. Be itr the whole family or a part of the family ie a few members who want to work on their bonds, I aspire to be able to provide a safe space for all that can facilitate both insight as well as action for the family as a unit to function better. The therapist, in the initial interview session, will take history from the family members and will devise a therapeutic plan based on the goal of therapy and the challenge that needs to be navigated. Using therapeutic tools and techniques, concerns of all the members and family as a whole will be addressed. Sometimes, individual sessions may be recommended for some members. The family or therapist are free to terminate at any time, or close therapy when the goals are met. </p>
